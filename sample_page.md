## Travel review

**Project description:** The Travel Review website is for all users who want to get all the information about cities around the world in one easy way and in one place. The site allows users to share their experiences about visited cities with other users, which is made possible by leaving reviews. The review consists of entering comments/observations, photos, and ratings by different criteria, such as gastronomic offer, cultural and artistic content, nightlife, transportation, etc. Based on user reviews, the site gives an insight into the best or worst rated cities. The site distinguishes three types of users: administrator, registered user and guest.

### Microservices architecture

Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo. 

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### Security

Security was implemented on the application using the Oauth2 specification. Oauth2 involves creating an Authorization Server that will authenticate the user and assign a token to him later to access other Resource Servers.
